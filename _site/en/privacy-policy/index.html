                <h2>The Civethica Foundation Privacy Policy</h2>
                <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> August 2, 2025</p>
                
                <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
                <p>The Civethica Foundation is a non-formal civil initiative created to promote the ideas of a new planetary consciousness. We deeply respect your privacy and aim to be fully transparent about how we handle data. This policy explains what data we may collect and how we use it.</p>
                
                <h3>2. What Data We Collect</h3>
                <p>Our site collects two types of data:</p>
                <p><strong>a) Non-Personal Data Collected Automatically:</strong><br>
                When you visit our site, our servers and analytics systems (e.g., Google Analytics) may automatically collect technical information that does not personally identify you: your browser type and operating system, IP address (in anonymized form), the pages you visited on our site and the time spent on them, and the source from which you came to our site.</p>
                
                <p><strong>b) Personal Data You Provide Voluntarily:</strong><br>
                We collect personal data only if you provide it to us yourself. For example, if you contact us by email, we will use your address to respond to your inquiry. We do not collect sensitive information and do not offer the ability to create personal accounts on our site.</p>
                
                <h3>3. How We Use Your Data</h3>
                <p>We use the collected data exclusively for the following purposes: to analyze and improve the site and to respond to your inquiries. We never sell, trade, or transfer your personal data to third parties for commercial purposes.</p>
                
                <h3>4. Cookies</h3>
                <p>Our site uses cookiesâ€”small text files stored on your device. They help us analyze traffic using Google Analytics. You can disable the use of cookies in your browser settings.</p>
                
                <h3>5. Third-Party Services</h3>
                <p>Our site contains links to third-party services such as Patreon and Facebook. When you follow these links, you leave our site. Actions on these platforms are governed by their own privacy policies.</p>
                
                <h3>6. Your Rights</h3>
                <p>You have the right to request access to the personal data we may have about you, and to request its correction or deletion. To do so, please contact us by email.</p>
                
                <h3>7. Changes to This Policy</h3>
                <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page.</p>
