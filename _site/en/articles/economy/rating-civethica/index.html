          <h3>
            We are used to measuring a company's success in money. It's time to measure it by its contribution to the
            health of our civilization.
          </h3>

          <p>
            We live in an era of paradoxes. A company can claim to be engaged in "sustainable development" while
            simultaneously destroying ecosystems thousands of kilometers from its headquarters. A brand can talk about
            "social responsibility" while using slave labor in third-world countries. We see brilliant financial reports
            and hear loud declarations, but we intuitively feel that something else is hidden behind this facade.
          </p>

          <p>
            The existing system for evaluating business is broken. It is built on the illusion that financial profit is
            synonymous with success. This illusion allows "greenwashing" and "ethics-washing" to flourish, where a
            beautiful marketing wrapper conceals toxic content.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Civethica Foundation offers a radically new approach:
            <strong>The Civethica Rating for Business</strong>. This is not just another set of criteria. It is a new
            coordinate system designed to answer a single question: what is the true systemic contribution of this
            company to the health of the planet, society, and human consciousness?
          </p>

          <hr />

          <h3>Why Don't Old Metrics Work?</h3>
          <p>Imagine two companies.</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Company A</strong> produces ultra-cheap "fast fashion." Its financial performance is magnificent:
            billion-dollar profits, soaring stock prices. But what is its real cost? The depletion of water resources,
            pollution of the oceans with microplastics, promotion of a culture of overconsumption, and the exploitation
            of low-paid labor. Systemically, this company takes more from the world than it gives.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Company B</strong> develops water purification technology and implements it in developing countries.
            Its profits may be modest. But its systemic contribution is enormous: it improves the health of millions,
            restores ecosystems, and promotes social stability. Systemically, this company is healing the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the current financial paradigm, Company A is a "success," and Company B is a "niche project." The
            Civethica Rating is designed to turn this logic on its head.
          </p>

          <h3>Three Dimensions of True Contribution</h3>
          <p>
            We evaluate companies along three interconnected axes that cover their entire life cycle—from idea to
            impact.
          </p>

          <ol class="manifesto-list">
            <li>
              <strong>The Value Creation Cycle: "What and How Do You Do It?"</strong>
              <p>This is an analysis of the production chain and the product itself.</p>
              <p>
                <strong>Product Ethics and Impact on Human Health:</strong> This is a direct and uncompromising
                criterion. We analyze whether a company's product makes people's lives better or worse.
              </p>
              <ul class="manifesto-sublist">
                <li>
                  <strong>Positive Contribution:</strong> Developing medicines, producing healthy food, creating
                  educational technologies, tools for mental well-being.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Negative Contribution:</strong> Manufacturing products that cause addiction (tobacco, alcohol,
                  gambling), contribute to chronic diseases (ultra-processed foods high in sugar and fat), or create a
                  harmful information environment.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                <strong>Environmental Ethics:</strong> How do you use resources? How do you minimize waste? Do you
                restore nature or deplete it?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Social Ethics:</strong> What are the working conditions for your employees and contractors? Is
                the pay fair? Are human rights respected at all stages of production?
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>The Value Distribution Cycle: "Where Do Your Money and Influence Go?"</strong>
              <p>
                This is our key difference from other ratings. We believe it is not enough to produce a "clean" product.
                It is critically important what the resulting profit and influence are spent on.
              </p>
              <p>
                A company can produce the most organic yogurt in the world, but if its profits go to funding a political
                party that incites war, supporting terrorist organizations, or organizing disinformation campaigns—its
                systemic contribution is deeply negative.
              </p>
              <p>Here we assess:</p>
              <ul class="manifesto-sublist">
                <li>
                  <strong>Political Influence:</strong> Who does the company finance and lobby for? Does it promote
                  peace and democracy or militarism and authoritarianism?
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Informational Influence:</strong> Does the company fight disinformation or is it a source of
                  it? Does it engage in "informational terrorism" against competitors or entire communities?
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Tax Ethics:</strong> Does the company pay taxes where it earns its profits, or does it move
                  money to offshore accounts, depriving society of resources for medicine and education?
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Ownership Structure:</strong> Who is the ultimate beneficiary of the company? Are there
                  criminal or sanctioned entities behind it?
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>The Principle of Openness: "Can You Be Trusted?"</strong>
              <p>
                Trust is impossible without transparency. Therefore, the methodology of the Civethica Rating will be
                completely open-source. Any expert, journalist, or citizen will be able to verify our data and
                understand how the assessment was formed. We do not issue a verdict—we provide the tools for an informed
                conclusion.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h3>The Future We Can Choose</h3>
          <p>The Civethica Rating is not just an assessment tool. It is a lever for transformation. It is needed:</p>
          <ul class="manifesto-sublist">
            <li>For conscious investors, to direct capital to companies that are building a healthy future.</li>
            <li>For thoughtful consumers, so their purchases become a voice in support of real values.</li>
            <li>For talented employees, to choose employers whose mission aligns with their own.</li>
            <li>
              For the companies themselves, to get an honest map of their systemic impact and find ways for real
              improvement.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <div class="conclusion-it">
            <p>
              We invite experts, analysts, researchers, and all concerned citizens to join the dialogue on creating and
              developing this vital tool. It is time to demand not only financial but also civilizational responsibility
              from business.
