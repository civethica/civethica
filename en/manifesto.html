          <h2>Civethica: A Manifesto for a New Consciousness</h2>

          <h3>Time to Change Course.</h3>
          <p>
            The world we live in is built on the ideas of profit and power at any cost. These goals have been placed
            above human life and above Nature since the dawn of civilization. The individual becomes a mere cog in
            someone else's machine, and the planet, a source of raw material for others' ambitions. On this path, we
            lose not only the Earth's resources but also our clarity of thought, our understanding of the true value of
            all living things, and the interconnectedness of all existence. Our reason grows weary of contradictions,
            and chaos takes root, destroying relationships in the family, in society, and among humankind. Man himself
            becomes a resource, no longer able to comprehend that his Home is approaching a critical point of existence.
            This manifesto is not a set of rules, but an invitation to a new way of seeing and being.
          </p>

          <h3>The Time for a New Way of Thinking Has Come.</h3>
          <p>
            We declare that humanity needs a new organizational structure—one based on
            <strong>universal human values</strong> that connect us with each other, with Nature, the Planet, and the
            Cosmos. These values are not yet formalized into a unified system for all humanity, but such a system must
            be created—as an inner compass that defines the life activity of individuals and the policies of nations, as
            the foundation for sustainable development into the future. This value system, independent of race,
            nationality, statehood, religion, and other political, social, and economic constructs, is determined by a
            simple fact: we live in one physical world, we have one Planet, and we share one common biosphere and
            climate, all experiencing the destructive impact of the anthropogenic factor. There can be no multipolar
            approach here. There can be only one pole—the comprehensive care and protection of our common Home,
            beginning with the attitude of each individual. And all of this depends on us, on the single step each of us
            takes—to realize these values and to share them with others.
          </p>

          <h3>From the Cosmos to the Human: An Interconnected System of Values</h3>
          <ol class="manifesto-list">
            <li>
              <strong>The Cosmos</strong> — We are part of a grand universe that we are only beginning to comprehend and
              explore. The Solar System is not an abstraction but a defining part of a single continuum for us, giving
              life to planet Earth.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>The Planet</strong> — Planet Earth is a unique cosmic formation where conditions for the origin,
              support, and development of carbon-based life have emerged. Its chemical richness, the presence of water,
              and the protective functions of its magnetosphere are parameters whose balance determines our life.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>The Biosphere</strong> — The living envelope of the Earth, encompassing all forms of life and
              their interactions with the environment. It is a thin, dynamic system where every element plays a role in
              maintaining the overall balance. The disruption of one link can affect the entire chain.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>The Climate</strong> — The key regulator of life, formed in the complex interaction of solar
              energy, the atmosphere, oceans, ice, and ecosystems. A stable climate is a condition for sustainable
              development, and its changes are a challenge to the entire biosphere and humanity.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>The Human</strong> — The conscious element of this system. We are a product of the biosphere's
              evolution, but we have also become a factor that changes it. The awareness of our responsibility, our
              capacity for foresight, and our moral choice makes a person not just a part, but a potential guardian of
              the entire system—or its destroyer.
              <ol type="a" class="manifesto-sublist">
                <li>
                  <strong>Culture</strong> — The form of expression of human experience, knowledge, and feelings.
                  Through language, art, traditions, and technology, we comprehend the world, pass on values, and form
                  identity. Culture connects generations and creates the semantic space necessary for harmonious
                  existence.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Consciousness</strong> — A unique manifestation of the human capacity for reflection, ethical
                  choice, and intuitive understanding. It is not only a biological function of the brain but also the
                  foundation of thought, empathy, and care—that which makes us human.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Ethics</strong> — The axis upon which sustainable human relationships are built. Ethical
                  principles help us not just to survive, but to live with dignity, in respect for other species,
                  cultures, and future generations. Ethics is the bridge between knowledge and action.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Technology</strong> — An extension of human capabilities, but also a zone of special
                  responsibility. It can be a tool of destruction or a means of preserving and restoring balance with
                  nature. Conscious technological development is part of a mature interaction with the environment.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Memory</strong> — The understanding of oneself on the axis of time: from the past, through the
                  present, to the future. Humanity must consider the consequences of its actions not only in the moment
                  but also on the scale of generations. Memory of the past and responsibility for the future form mature
                  thinking.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ol>

          <div class="conclusion">
            <p><strong>Civethica</strong> is the path from egoism to co-evolution.</p>
            <p>It is a turn from the ideology of profit and power to the stewardship of our Home.</p>
            <p>It is a choice in favor of the preservation and development of Life and Reason.</p>
